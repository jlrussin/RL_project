Notes
  -Should just compare on one or two games:
    1. MFEC with random projection
    2. MFEC with autoencoder
    3. MFEC with successor features
    4. NEC with CNN-DND
    5. NEC with CNN-DND and successor feature regularization?

Things to do:
  -Test NEC and DND in tinker_nec
  -Add comments to all empty files in repo
  -Set up filesystem inside and outside of repo
    -Results folder (with subdirs for each model)
  -Commit, push
  -Pull to cluster
  -Set up file system on cluster
  -Check that all deepmind wrappers work from openai baselines
    -Don't understand LazyFrames and FrameStack
    -Should include changes made to atari_wrapper from mjacar?
