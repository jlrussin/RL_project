Notes
  -Should just compare on one or two games:
    1. MFEC with random projection
    2. MFEC with autoencoder
    3. MFEC with successor features
    4. NEC with CNN-DND
    5. NEC with CNN-DND and successor feature regularization?
  -Make sure to take wrappers into account when compare results to papers
    -e.g. Pong has special wrapper

Things to do:
  -Use with torch.no_grad() in NEC when doing lookups?
  -sklearn has faster kd-tree? Change code in NEC to use sklearn?
  -Testing on cluster:
    -Timing: gpu vs. cpu (cpu wins?)
    -Timing: scaling with number of cpus (all pretty similar, 4 was best?)
    -Timing: scaling with size of kd-tree
    -Memory: scaling with size of kd-tree
  -Training NEC with Adam causes key errors?
