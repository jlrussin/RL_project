Notes
  -Should just compare on one or two games:
    1. MFEC with random projection
    2. MFEC with autoencoder
    3. MFEC with successor features
    4. NEC with CNN-DND
    5. NEC with CNN-DND and successor feature regularization?
  -Make sure to take wrappers into account when compare results to papers
    -e.g. Pong has special wrapper

Things to do:
  -Change train to incorporate environment
  -Make models accept arbitrary height and width
  -Run MFEC random, MFEC VAE, NEC on tabular case
  -Build MNIST version
  -Build MFEC_SR
  -Build NEC_SR?
  -Training NEC with Adam causes key errors?
