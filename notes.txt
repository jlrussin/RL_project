Notes

Things to do:
  -Decide on hyperparameters of all models: search over relevant spaces
    -Get a good set of hyperparameters for VAE and save model
  -Figures:
    -Visualize environment with digits
    -Algorithms for all models side by side (or just one for MFEC with different phi?)
    -Visualize true underlying tabular SR
  -Results:
    -Training curves for comparable MFEC_random, MFEC_VAE
    -Training curves for MFEC_SR_DP, MFEC_SR_TD
    -Visualize PCA/MDS of random, VAE, SR_DP, SR_TD embeddings
      -Write script to get embeddings from SR_TD from trained model
      -Write script to get embeddings from VAE
    -Visualize samples from VAE? - write script
  -Try to run NEC?
  -Clean up code:
    -Should just remove all Atari stuff?
    -Add conditionals/assertions to make sure no atari-incompatible code runs
  -Training NEC with Adam causes key errors?
