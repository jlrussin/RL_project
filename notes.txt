Notes
  -Should just compare on one or two games:
    1. MFEC with random projection
    2. MFEC with autoencoder
    3. MFEC with successor features
    4. NEC with CNN-DND
    5. NEC with CNN-DND and successor feature regularization?

Things to do:
  -Test NEC on Atari on gpu (Josh is using all of them right now)
  -Training NEC with Adam causes key errors?
  -Make DND compatible with MFEC
    -Add option in DND for not using Parameter() tensors for keys
